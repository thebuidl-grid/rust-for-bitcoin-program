# Week 1 — Bitcoin Fundamentals

## Summary
This week, I learned how Bitcoin operates from the ground up:
- Setting up a Bitcoin node and running it in regtest mode
- Understanding block creation and coinbase maturity
- Managing wallets, sending and decoding transactions
- Inspecting UTXOs and simulating a full payment workflow

## Key Takeaways
- **UTXOs** form the foundation of Bitcoin’s accounting model.
- **Regtest mode** is perfect for local testing without using real BTC.
- **Coinbase maturity** (100 blocks) prevents immediate spending.
